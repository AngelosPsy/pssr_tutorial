# pssr tutorial

Thank you for using the pssr package. In order to allow the easy use of our 
package, we have created an online tutorial. The html file of the tutorial is available here: [html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/AngelosPsy/pssr_tutorial/blob/master/tutorial_pssr.html).
If you prefer printing out the tutorial, you may want to use the pdf version 
instead  that is available here: [pdf](tutorial_pssr.pdf). 
Please note that there are slight format varations between between the html and the pdf version of the 
tutorial, with
the pdf version not supporting web- and text links, but the content is 
the same. 

We are always open to requests, and we would be happy to answer any questions.
For contacting us, just create an issue here:

help for creating an issue, you can get more information through this
